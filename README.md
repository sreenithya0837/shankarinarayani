XYZ CORPORATION LENDING DATASET

In general, whenever an corporation applies for a loan from a bank (or any loan issuer), their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan (in this industry it is referred to as credit-worthiness).

The measure is generally in the form of a probability and is the risk that the person will default on their loan (called the probability of default) in the future.
Based on the amount of risk that the issuer is willing to take (plus some other factors) they decide on a cutoff of that score and use it to take a decision regarding whether to pass the loan or not. 
This is a way of managing credit risk. The whole process collectively is referred to as underwriting.


Overview of the problem
In this project you will have to put yourself in the shoes of a loan issuer and manage credit risk by using the past data and 
deciding whom to give the loan to in the future. The text files contain complete loan data for all loans issued by XYZ Corp. through 2007-2015. 
The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc.
